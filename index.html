    <h1>Qbot</h1>

    <p>Questions:

	  1. In JavaScript, write a self invoked function that adds a variable called "Introduction" to the top level window namespace. This variable should be an object with three properties: a string (name), a number (age), and a function (greeting). The function should return, "Hello, my name is [name] and I am [age] years old." Outside of the immediately invoked function, set the name and age properties of Introduction, then log the result of the greeting method to the console.

	  2. In JavaScript and with CSS, create a chat interface to give the user information about their astrology sign. The user will land on the page and the automated bot will ask, "What's your birthday?" The user can enter their date of birth and submit it. The automated bot will inform their user of their sign (Virgo, etc.) and ask then ask if they'd like to receive a horoscope. Depending on the user's answer of yes or no, the automated bot should be able to produce a horoscope or say goodbye. The horoscope can be as simple or complex as you'd like. Please use CSS (do not use Bootstrap or any similar framework) to style the conversation to look like a traditional chat based interface (iMessage, for example). Make sure to handle any errors for invalid date inputs.</p>
